    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <h3>Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the
        behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.</h3>
    <p>
      OR gate: output 1 if any inputs are 1, otherwise 0.<br/>
      AND gate: output 1 if all inputs are 1, otherwise 0.<br/>
      NOR gate: output 1 if no inputs are 1, otherwise 0.<br/>
      NAND gate: output 1 unless all inputs are 1.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <h3>A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many 
        inputs and outputs?</h3>
    <p>
      Two components: an AND gate and an XOR gate (which is itself probably
      composed of an OR, a NAND, and an AND gate).
    </p>
    <p>
      Two inputs (one for each bit) and two outputs, for the sum and the carry.
    </p>
    <h3>A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many 
        inputs and outputs?</h3>
    <p>
      Three components: two half adders and an OR gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three inputs and two outputs for sum and carry.
    </p>
    <h3>How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding
        circuit?</h3>
    <p>
      Seventeen inputs for each bit of the two 8-bit inputs, plus an extra
      because we're using full adders. Nine outputs for each bit of the output.
      The ninth output might be considered extraneous too since computers add
      with overflow, writing the result of an 8-bit addition to yet another 
      8-bit number, even if the result is incorrect*. However,
      <a href="http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm#cpuregistersandflags">some</a> 
      (most? all?) CPUs keep track of whether the last arithmetic operation 
      resulted in a carry, making the carry out bit useful to machine code.
    </p>
    <p>
      *The statement <code>255 + 1 = 0</code> isn't actually wrong if you're 
      talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">
      addition modulo 256.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the
        8-bit adder?</h3>
    <p>
      144.

    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <h3>Define byte.</h3>
    <p>
      A byte is generally the smallest addressable unit of information in a 
      computer system and can usually be assumed to be 8 bits in length.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the range of an unsigned byte? A signed two's complement
        byte?</h3>
    <p>
      An unsigned byte ranges from 0 to 255; a signed byte ranges from -128 to
      127.
    </p>
    <h3>What does the X in the following binary number represent
        1010X10101?</h3>
    <p>
      The X represents 32 (2^6). 1010110101 is 32 greater than 1010010101.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the base 16 number system called?</h3>
    <p>
      Hexadecimal, from the Greek <i>hex</i> for <i>six</i> and the Latin
      <i>decimus</i> for <i>ten</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is base 16 a good choice for representing binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>
      Since 16 is a power of two, the full range of a byte can be expressed in
      exactly two hexadecimal digits, e.g. hexadecimal ff is binary 11111111.
    </p>
    <h3>What base 16 number is 101011000011? What is an easy way to determine
        this without using a calculator?</h3>
    <p>
      Each group of 4 bits corresponds to a hex digit. In 1010 1100 0011, the
      bits correspond to 8 + 2, 8 + 4, and 1 + 2, i.e. 10, 12, and 3. Written in
      hex, those values are a, c and 3. So the hex representation is ac3.
    </p>
    <h3>What does the X represent in the following base 16 number D4AXF0?</h3>
    <p>
      The X represents 256 (16^2).
    </p>
    <h3>The book describes how to convert decimal to base 2 or base 16. Research
        and describe a technique that allows conversion of decimal to any base
        (2-36).</h3>
    <p>
    I wrote code to do that <a href="./baseN.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technique is this: append the number modulo the base to the string of
      digits. Then integer-divide the number by the base. Repeat until the
      number is 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a special case where the number starts out as 0; when that
      happens, its representation in any base is just 0.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
    <h3>What do the prefix names kilo, mega, giga, tera, and peta represent in
        bytes and what were the Greek origins of the words?</h3>
    <p>
      1000<sup>1</sup>, 1000<sup>2</sup>, 1000<sup>3</sup>, 1000<sup>4</sup>,
      and 1000<sup>5</sup> respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Kilo-</i> is derived from the Greek word for "thousand". <i>Mega-</i>,
      <i>giga-</i>, and <i>tera-</i> are derived from Greek words meaning "great",
      "giant", and "monster" respectively, and <i>peta-</i> has the same
      etymology as <i>penta-</i>, coming from the Greek <i>πέντε</i> for "five".
    </p>
    <h3>At the end of Chapter 16 the author reminds the reader about something
        that is "very important," what is this?</h3>
    <p>
      RAM requires a constant flow of electricity. When it loses power, all the
      information it contains is lost too.
