    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <h3>Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the
        behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.</h3>
    <p>
      OR gate: output 1 if any inputs are 1, otherwise 0.<br/>
      AND gate: output 1 if all inputs are 1, otherwise 0.<br/>
      NOR gate: output 1 if no inputs are 1, otherwise 0.<br/>
      NAND gate: output 1 unless all inputs are 1.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <h3>A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many 
        inputs and outputs?</h3>
    <p>
      Two components: an AND gate and an XOR gate (which is itself probably
      composed of an OR, a NAND, and an AND gate).
    </p>
    <p>
      Two inputs (one for each bit) and two outputs, for the sum and the carry.
    </p>
    <h3>A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many 
        inputs and outputs?</h3>
    <p>
      Three components: two half adders and an OR gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three inputs and two outputs for sum and carry.
    </p>
    <h3>How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding
        circuit?</h3>
    <p>
      Seventeen inputs for each bit of the two 8-bit inputs, plus an extra
      because we're using full adders. Nine outputs for each bit of the output.
      The ninth output might be considered extraneous too since computers add
      with overflow, writing the result of an 8-bit addition to yet another 
      8-bit number, even if the result is incorrect*. However,
      <a href="http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm#cpuregistersandflags">some</a> 
      (most? all?) CPUs keep track of whether the last arithmetic operation 
      resulted in a carry, making the carry out bit useful to machine code.
    </p>
    <p>
      *The statement <code>255 + 1 = 0</code> isn't actually wrong if you're 
      talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">
      addition modulo 256.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the
        8-bit adder?</h3>
    <p>
      144.
