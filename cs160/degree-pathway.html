    Cascades's undergrad CS program</a> is geared toward web and mobile software
    development. Both Corvallis and Cascades require students to apply to the 
    Engineering Professional Program to be eligible to register  for 
    higher-level courses, which involves passing a certain set of more general 
    courses.

  <h3>Grad Program</h3>
  <p>
    OSU Cascades campus does not offer a graduate program in CS, so graduate
    courses have to be taken at Corvallis campus.
