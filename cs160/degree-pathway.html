  <h1>Degree Pathway</h1>
  <h2>OSU</h2>
  <h3>Undergrad Program</h3>
  <p>
    OSU Corvallis offers a Computer Systems option and an Applied option for their
    computer science bachelor's degree program.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://goo.gl/BP1yqj">Here is a sample plan for the Computer Systems program.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://goo.gl/W4YRFf">Here is the applied program.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    According to <a href="https://goo.gl/dTEcyR">this page</a>, the applied
    option allows students to develop a custom program and submit it for
    approval. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://osucascades.edu/sites/osucascades.edu/files/Advising/cs_1718_1.pdf">OSU
    Cascades's undergrad CS program</a> is geared toward web and mobile software
    development. Both Corvallis and Cascades require students to apply to the 
    Engineering Professional Program to be eligible to register  for 
    higher-level courses, which involves passing a certain set of more general 
    courses.
  </p>
  <h3>Grad Program</h3>
  <p>
    OSU Cascades campus does not offer a graduate program in CS, so graduate
    courses have to be taken at Corvallis campus.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/graduate-students/cs-program">graduate
    CS program</a> offers an M.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. 
  </p>
  <h2>PSU</h2>
  <h3>Undergrad Program</h3>
  <p>
    Portland State's bachelor program is similar to OSU's. As far as I can tell,
    PSU doesn't have specialized options under the CS degree like OSU's Computer
    Systems and Applied programs. There is a sample 4-year course plan
    <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/sites/www.pdx.edu.computer-science/files/CS%202018-19%20Blue%20Sheet.pdf">
    here.</a>
    There is a capstone program, where students work in teams on software
    development projects for local companies. I think it's interesting that,
    judging by <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/sites/www.pdx.edu.computer-science/files/Prerequisite%20Graph.pdf">
    this</a> graph of the prerequisites for each CS course, PSU expects students
    to already know a programming language going into the introductory course.
  </p>
  <h3>Grad Program</h3>
  <p>
    PSU offers a Master of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy. The M.S. gives
    students the option to write and defend a thesis, but they are also free not
    to. It's not clear to me what the incentive is to do the thesis, unless you
    just want the educational experience. It seems like you could just do
    that on your own if you really wanted to. It's mysterious.
