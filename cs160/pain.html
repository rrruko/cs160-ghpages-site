  <h1>Inevitable Pain</h1>
  <p>
    Berry's central claim is that the volatility of the requirements of a
    software project almost always necessitates changes that go against the
    architecture of the system. It's often easiest to implement these changes in
    ways that decay the structure of the program; for example, to preserve
    information hiding often requires module-level refactoring. Because
    implementing these changes in a way that avoids decay is painful,
    programmers tend to avoid it.
  <p>
  </p>
    Berry discusses multiple programming methodologies and ways they fail, to
    various extents, to address the inevitable pain of this decaying effect. For
    instance, waterfall programming aims to make programmers fully understand
    requirements before starting work, but requirements are still frequently
    discovered only after a great deal of architecture has been put in place.
