    <h1>Dreaming in Code Answers</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 0</h2>
    <h3>Who wrote "software is hard?" Who is that guy?</h3>
    <p>
      Donald Knuth, author of <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> and TeX. 
    </p>
    <h3>Programmers start counting at what number?</h3>
    <p>
      0, sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most programming languages, listy containers are indexed starting from
      0. This tradition derives from the implementation details of array
      indexing and related mathematical phenomena; in other words, it often
      makes more sense to start from 0 in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance: we access elements of an array <code>a</code> by writing 
      <code>a[n]</code>, which desugars to <code>*(a + n)</code>. 
      But because <code>*a</code> just refers to the start of the array, i.e., the
      first element, and because <code>*(a + 0) = *a</code>, thus <code>a[0]</code> 
      accesses that element.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, given <code>a = ['A', 'B', 'C']</code>, we have <code>a[0] =
      'A'</code>. The first element is the one corresponding to the label 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's tempting to say that programmers should just stop being weird and
      count from 1 like everyone else. Languages like Lua enforce this
      perspective by numbering arrays from 1. But that isn't a perfect solution,
      because counting is hard.
    </p>
    <img src="fencepost.svg">
    <p>
      How many fenceposts do you need to make a 10-foot fence with posts 1 foot
      apart? If you don't think about it carefully, you might answer 10. We
      think of it as an easy problem, but even counting can be hard sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real world is governed by math, and math is hard. When we really 
      engage with math we reveal the perilous complexities inherent in the real
      world. As humans, we construct abstractions to help avoid these
      complexities, and as programmers, it is our job to translate between these
      complexities and the human intution. The translation is usually lossy.

    <h3>What was the original sense of a "hacker?"</h3>
    <p>
      "Hacker" originally had nothing to do with computer security. A hacker, in
      the original sense, was someone who embodied the virtues of computer
      culture, and was associated with an attitude of creativity and playfulness 
      with respect to software.
    </p>
    <h3>According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly
        late, over budget, or was canceled?</h3>
    <p>  
      Two out of three.
    </p>
    <h3>Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?”</h3>
    <p>
      Fred Brooks. 
    </p>
    <p>
      "No silver bullet" means that there is essential complexity inherent in
      programming that can't easily be solved by the use of a better tool. At
      the time, hardware was improving rapidly and some people expected the same
      rate of improvement in software. Brooks claimed that this wasn't possible
      because software was in some sense harder.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <h3>What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted
        Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold.</h3>
    <p>
      Toy was manager. Anderson was systems architect and the de facto lead 
      coder. Kapor was founder of the Open Source Applications Foundation. 
      Montulli and Burgess were programmers.
    </p>
    <h3>What is “Bugzilla?”</h3>
    <p>
      A bug tracking program that the team used to record estimated times to fix
      bugs.
    </p>
    <h3>What is OSAF?</h3>
    <p>
      The Open Source Applications Foundation, the organization in charge of the
      Chandler project.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the projects name?</h3>
    <p>
      Chandler.
    </p>
    <h3>What will the software do?</h3>
    <p>
      It was supposed to be a "personal information manager" for organizing
      calendars, emails, and to-do lists.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs?</h3>
    <p>
      "Scary".
    </p>
    <h3>What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?</h3>
    <p>
      It had a "black hole-like quality", because nobody could estimate how long
      it would take to fix.
    </p>
    <h3>What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”</h3>
    <p>
      An important problem that the team didn't have consensus on how to attack.
    </p>
    <h3>In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?</h3>
    <p>
      Lateness.
    </p>
    <h3>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software
        project?</h3>
    <p>
      The IBM System/360.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Brooks's Law?</h3>
    <p>
      "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." 
    </p>
    <h3>Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?</h3>
    <p>One-sixth.</p>
    <h3>Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing
        bugs?</h3>
    <p>One-half.</p>
    <h3>Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied
        under what conditions?</h3>
    <p>
      Only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no
      communication among them. Adding new people to a project often costs 
      so much more extra time spent communicating with the new members that it
      isn't worth the time saved by splitting up work.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the difference between source code and the program you install
        (.exe) on your computer?</h3>
    <p>
      Executable files consist of machine code, which consists of instructions
      that can be directly interpreted by the processor. They are almost never
      written directly by a human, but instead generated by running a compiler
      on source code written in a more expressive and human-readable language.
      Such as INTERCAL.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free”
        software advocates share?</h3>
    <p>
      That if the source code of a program is freely available, it will
      eventually become better than any closed software.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great”
        programmer?</h3>
    <p>
      "Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and
      reuse)."
    </p>
    <h3>Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction
        between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast
        them.</h3>
    <p>
      Cathedral–Release it when it's finished. Keep the team small and their
      agendas similar.<br/>
      Bazaar–Release early and often. Delegate everything to people with all
      kinds of different agendas and approaches.
    </p>
    <h3>Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s
        “mythical man-month” concerns?</h3>
    <p>
      The internet allows developers to make information about their projects
      easily accessible to anyone. This means less time is spent bringing new
      developers up to speed, and it becomes genuinely beneficial to have
      hundreds or thousands of contributors.
    </p>
    <h3>What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to
        have stalled?</h3>
    <p>
      Hertzfeld advocated getting draft versions of the project up and running
      as quickly as possible before working out all the design details.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <h3>Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to
        software, explain.</h3>
    <p>
      Science relies on everybody sharing knowledge. If a field of study, like
      witchcraft, doesn't share knowledge, it will die out. Torvalds claims that
      closed source software is like witchcraft, and therefore doomed to fail.
    </p>
    <h3>People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their
        computer. What was the origin of this term?</h3>
    <p>
      "Booting" is short for "bootstrapping", which refers to "an improving of
      the improvement process."
    </p>
    <h3>Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?</h3>
    <p>
      Palo Alto Research Center.
    </p>
    <h3>List three software project “train wrecks.”</h3>
    <p>
      Trilogy, Future Combat System, 2004 UK pension system crash.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <h3>When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks
        advise “plan to throw one away?”</h3>
    <p>
      Because you won't get it right the first time.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?</h3>
    <p>
      A core dump is a copy of the contents of a computer's memory after a fatal
      error. Memory is sometimes called the core because computer memory was 
      once built out of ferrite cores.
    </p>
    <h3>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110
        1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?</h3>
    <p>
      Assembly.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created:
        Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind
        of program converted Fortran to binary?</h3>
    <p>
      A compiler.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <h3>What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?</h3>
    <p>
      The front end of a program is the part that a user interacts with. The
      back end is everything else.
    </p>
    <h3>What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?</h3>
    <p>
      The notion that software development is reducible to composing reusable
      parts without writing any code.
    </p>
    <h3>Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.</h3>
    <p>
      Programmers already strive to extract common patterns as much as they can.
      But programs that do useful things are complicated because the world is
      complicated. There are as many patterns as there are tasks. Patterns that
      are particularly common are already factored out into libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole point of programming langauge design is to make correct programs
      as easy to build as possible. Text has been the medium of software
      development because it is flexible enough to deal with complexity. If the
      Lego Hypothesis were to be realized, it would have to use components with
      similar flexibility to existing languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, some tasks legitimately aren't as complicated as others.
      I think there are some things that are done by powerful, Turing-complete
      languages that might be better done with simpler tools, and things like
      that might be more amenable to Lego-like systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <h3>What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to
        overcome.</h3>
    <p>
      Fast, cheap, or good: pick two.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the more recent definition of “geek?”</h3>
    <p>
      A person who immerses themselves in the details of systems and pursues
      technical skill.
    </p>
    <h3>What does “refactoring” mean to programmers?</h3>
    <p>
      Rewriting code to improve its quality without changing its function.
    </p>
    <h3>What is “yak-shaving?”</h3>
    <p>
      A seemingly-pointless activity which is indirectly necessary to solve an 
      actual problem.
