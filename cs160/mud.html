<h1>Big Ball of Mud</h1>
<p>
    In his article about the Big Ball of Mud, Scott Rosenberg discusses programs
    without architecture and attempts to offer some defense of writing
    unstructured programs. He makes two points that interest me. The first is
    that it is often a better business decision to release bad code that works
    than to polish that code and release it a little later. This is surely true
    in some cases, but I worry about the possibility of a person making the
    decision to release early without understanding the dangers of bad code,
    such as the long-term cost resulting from the code being harder to maintain. 
</p>

    Rosenberg also mentioned a possible "secret advantage": a system with few
    constraints is easier to change. Usually constraints on program behavior are
    good, because we want programs to be predictable, but in situations like
    early development of a video game, it can make sense to avoid structure so
    that it’s easier to make changes. At the same time, I think there is an
    important distinction between poorly written code and code that lacks
    restraints.  Spaghetti code, while lacking intended structure, isn’t
    necessarily easy to transform. Conversely, some practices that are
    universally approved, such as decomposing programs into smaller procedures,
    help make changing a program easier.
