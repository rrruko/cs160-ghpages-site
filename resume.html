    <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p>
        Most of my programming experience is with Haskell. I have also worked
        with C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Lua, Python, and Rust and a long time
        ago I used C# and Java, though I'm a bit rusty. I consider myself
        capable of picking up new technologies very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proficient with Linux and good with a terminal (my favorite text
        editor is vim).

        Wrote a raytracer in Haskell for fun. It reads .obj files and uses a custom
        material specification format that supports diffuse and reflective
        surfaces. The scene is partitioned using a BIH, which improved execution
        time over the brute-force solution by a factor of ~30.
